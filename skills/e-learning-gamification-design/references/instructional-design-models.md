## 2. SAM (Successive Approximation Model)

### Overview
SAM is an agile instructional design model that emphasizes iterative development and rapid prototyping.

### SAM Process

```
Analyze → Design → Develop → Evaluate → Repeat
                ↑                              ↓
                └────── Iterative Cycle ───────┘
```

### Key Characteristics

**Iterative Cycles**:
- Short development sprints (1-2 weeks)
- Continuous feedback integration
- Rapid prototyping from day one
- Flexible scope adjustment

**Stakeholder Involvement**:
- Regular review sessions
- Collaborative decision-making
- Quick consensus building
- Transparent progress visibility

**Rapid Prototyping**:
- Build functional prototypes early
- Test with actual users
- Refine based on feedback
- Avoid over-planning

### SAM vs ADDIE Comparison

| Aspect | ADDIE | SAM |
|--------|-------|-----|
| Approach | Linear/Sequential | Iterative/Cyclic |
| Planning | Extensive upfront | Just enough |
| Prototyping | Late in process | Early and often |
| Feedback | End of phases | Continuous |
| Flexibility | Lower | Higher |
| Best for | Stable requirements | Evolving requirements |

### When to Use SAM
- Uncertain or evolving requirements
- Need for quick time-to-market
- Stakeholders available for frequent input
- Innovation or experimental projects
- When user feedback is critical early

### Implementation Tips

1. **Start Small**: Begin with a prototype, not a full course
2. **Timebox**: Set strict time limits for each iteration
3. **Involve Users**: Get learner feedback on prototypes
4. **Embrace Change**: Be willing to pivot based on feedback
5. **Document Decisions**: Keep track of why decisions were made

## 3. Merrill's Principles of Instruction

### Overview
David Merrill's First Principles of Instruction provide a framework for effective, problem-centered learning design.

### The Five Principles

#### 1. Task-Centered Principle
**Concept**: Learning is promoted when learners are engaged in solving real-world problems.

**Application**:
- Start with real-world problems, not abstract concepts
- Progress from simple to complex problems
- Show how knowledge applies to practical situations

**Example**:
> Instead of teaching "project management concepts," start with "How do you manage a project that's behind schedule?"

#### 2. Activation Principle
**Concept**: Learning is promoted when relevant prior knowledge is activated.

**Application**:
- Connect new content to what learners already know
- Use pre-assessments to surface existing knowledge
- Create activities that recall relevant experience

**Example**:
> "Think about a time when you had to learn a new software tool. What helped you learn it effectively?"

#### 3. Demonstration Principle
**Concept**: Learning is promoted when the instruction demonstrates what is to be learned.

**Application**:
- Show examples of correct application
- Use multiple examples with varying contexts
- Highlight critical features and relationships

**Example**:
> Show a video of an expert completing the task, with commentary on key decisions

#### 4. Application Principle
**Concept**: Learning is promoted when learners apply their new knowledge.

**Application**:
- Provide practice opportunities
- Offer feedback on performance
- Gradually remove scaffolding

**Example**:
> After watching a demonstration, learners complete a similar task with guidance, then independently

#### 5. Integration Principle
**Concept**: Learning is promoted when learners integrate their new knowledge into their everyday world.

**Application**:
- Encourage reflection on learning
- Provide opportunities to transfer skills
- Connect to future applications

**Example**:
> "How will you apply this technique in your next project? What challenges might you face?"

### Design Template

| Principle | Design Question | Implementation |
|-----------|-----------------|----------------|
| Task-Centered | What real-world problem will learners solve? | Problem scenarios, case studies |
| Activation | What prior knowledge should be activated? | Pre-assessment, reflection questions |
| Demonstration | How will I show the desired performance? | Examples, modeling, walkthroughs |
| Application | What practice opportunities will I provide? | Exercises, simulations, projects |
| Integration | How will learners transfer to real contexts? | Action plans, reflection, follow-up |

## 4. Cognitive Load Theory

### Overview
Cognitive Load Theory (Sweller) explains how to optimize working memory during learning.

### Three Types of Cognitive Load

#### Intrinsic Load
**Definition**: The inherent complexity of the material itself.

**Management Strategies**:
- Break complex topics into simpler components
- Sequence from simple to complex
- Provide scaffolding for difficult concepts
- Use worked examples for complex procedures

**Example**:
> Teaching calculus: Start with basic functions, then derivatives, then integrals—each building on the previous.

#### Extraneous Load
**Definition**: Cognitive effort that doesn't contribute to learning (poor design).

**Reduction Strategies**:
- Eliminate unnecessary information
- Use clear, consistent navigation
- Place related information close together
- Avoid split-attention (integrate text with diagrams)
- Reduce on-screen text when using audio

**Example**:
> Instead of a diagram on one page and explanation on another, integrate labels directly on the diagram.

#### Germane Load
**Definition**: Mental effort devoted to processing and learning.

**Optimization Strategies**:
- Encourage elaboration and reflection
- Use varied examples and practice
- Promote schema construction
- Support metacognition

**Example**:
> After learning a concept, ask learners to explain it in their own words or teach it to someone else.

### Cognitive Load Design Checklist

- [ ] Unnecessary information removed
- [ ] Related elements placed together
- [ ] Consistent design patterns used
- [ ] Audio and text not redundant

## 5. Constructivist Approaches

### Overview
Constructivism views learning as an active process where learners build knowledge through experience.

### Key Approaches

#### Problem-Based Learning (PBL)
**Concept**: Learning through solving open-ended problems.

**Implementation**:
1. Present an authentic, ill-structured problem
2. Learners identify what they need to know
3. Self-directed research and learning
4. Apply new knowledge to the problem
5. Reflect on the learning process

**Best For**: Medical education, professional training, complex domains

#### Inquiry-Based Learning
**Concept**: Learning through questioning and investigation.

**Implementation**:
1. Pose a driving question or scenario
2. Learners generate hypotheses
3. Investigate to gather evidence
4. Analyze and draw conclusions
5. Share and defend findings

**Best For**: Science education, research skills, critical thinking

#### Social Constructivism
**Concept**: Learning through social interaction and collaboration.

**Implementation**:
- Collaborative projects
- Peer teaching
- Discussion forums
- Group problem-solving
- Community of practice

**Best For**: Soft skills, professional development, collaborative work

#### Experiential Learning (Kolb)
**Concept**: Learning through concrete experience and reflection.

**Cycle**:
1. **Concrete Experience**: Do something
2. **Reflective Observation**: Consider what happened
3. **Abstract Conceptualization**: Draw conclusions
4. **Active Experimentation**: Try something new

**Best For**: Skills training, leadership development, hands-on learning
